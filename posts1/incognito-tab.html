Once this malware is activated, the payload, also known as Redline, steals user usernames, passwords, cookies, and banking credentials from Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium browsers, and steals information from crypto wallets, instant messaging software, FTP, SSH, and even VPN clients. receiving In the same way, this malware opens the link in the default browser to download the software.
