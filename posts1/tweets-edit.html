You may remember last April, Twitter company officially announced that they hope to provide the ability to edit Tweets. Accordingly, they had indicated that they were going to give this to their Twitter Blue Lab users and test it.




<br><br>

According to the Twitter post posted by Twitter Blue's official Twitter account yesterday, the Twitter company has made arrangements to officially provide Tweet Editing facility for their Blue Lab users. However, the ability to edit Tweets like this is only available in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. They have also indicated that this facility will be provided to the United States in the next few daysNawa
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p class="ab" lang="en" dir="ltr">loving your edits, we're excited to continue expanding this test to new marketsâ€”can&#39;t wait to hear what you think!&mdash; Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1577007071689461761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=" https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>



<p class="ab">
However, according to another Tweet posted by Twitter, it can be indicated that they hope to provide this facility to other countries soon. Also, the Twitter Blue facility is currently only available for the four countries namely Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, so when providing the Tweet Edit facility for other countries, will the Twitter Blue facility be provided for those countries as well and this Edit facility will be provided through that, or not? No more official information has been published about whether it will be provided without it.

</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p class="ab" lang="en" dir="ltr">test went well, Edit Tweet is now rolling out to Twitter Blue members in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand ! <br><br>US coming soon <a href="https://t.co/7NNPRC0t1I">pic.twitter.com/7NNPRC0t1I</a>&mdash; Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1576980429814759424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=" https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>
<p class="ab">


Thus, when using the Tweet Editing facility, everyone can see what the Tweet was before editing, and it is certain that many Twitter users are happy that Twitter has finally introduced this feature.
