WhatsApp is not a messenger app that is available on every phone these days. This is the most used instant messaging service in the world. Even if there are better ones, our people don't want to change. So today we are looking at a way to get back a deleted WhatsApp chat.


<br><br>
Let's learn about <b>Chat Backups.
</b><br><br>

This Chat Backups facility is there to prevent the loss of your previous chats if you uninstall and reinstall the WhatsApp app or if you get a new phone. We are going to recover deleted messages by using this facility.

<br><br>

To retrieve deleted WhatsApp messages, you must enable Chat Backups before deleting the message. This is usually a setting that we make when we install the WhatsApp app anew.


<br><br>

WhatsApp has provided you with several types of automatic backup methods. You can choose Daily, Weekly or Monthly from this one of the daily, weekly or monthly options or off or try not to keep any backup. It is better to choose Daily if you want to recover deleted messages.


<br><br>

Here you need to remember that on iOS, WhatsApp stores only the most recently saved backup file. But Android keeps two recently backed up backup files.


<br><br>
To access Backup settings,



<br><br>

WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup


<br><br>
go to From the settings there, you can go to the chat backup that is saved locally on your phone and the chat backup settings that are saved to Google Drive. You can also select the desired chat backup frequency.



<br><br>
<img width="65%" src="img/6-1.jpg" class="center">


<br><br>
As mentioned before, by choosing Daily, you can get the messages of the last day in the chat that you deleted by mistake. If you select Weekly, you will get messages from the last week.



<br><br><b>
Let's recover deleted messages
</b>

<br><br>
All you have to do is uninstall the WhatsApp app and reinstall it.



<br><br>
After that, you need to register WhatsApp with the same number as before. After that, you will be asked if you want to restore, then you can restore the deleted messages with the help of your saved backup file.



<br><br>

<img width="65%" src="img/6-2.jpg" class="center">
<br><br>
Here it will be restored according to the frequency that was in the settings you made earlier. As I said before, it is better to have daily backups.

<hr>
So that's the simplest story. It is not a big deal to be able to restore all the chats that you have done for years or months, except for one day. We will meet again. You win!
