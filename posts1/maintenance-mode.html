Samsung has provided a successful solution to the problem of protecting one's personal data in a repair shop. It was introduced a while back but now users have been given the ability to actually use it.




<br><br>

With this maintenance mode introduced by Samsung, you can protect your personal data from other parties.

<br><br>

Samsung has launched this maintenance mode feature globally after successfully testing it in South Korea and China.


<br><br>

After turning this on, the phone will flashSwitch to a new guest user account that does not have access to any personal files such as photos, videos, documents, credit card information, and more.



<br><br>
 
That way, phone repairers can check if a phone is working and are allowed to test all basic functions and even install apps from the Galaxy Store (automatically removed after restart).



  <br><br>
And they won't be able to get past the maintenance mode barrier to browse your files.

  <br><br>
To enable this, you can go to Battery and device care in your phone's settings, then enable Maintenance mode. After doing so, your phone will be transferred to an account where you will not have access to any personal applications and files.

<br><br>
If you want to use it, keep an eye out for an OTA update coming to your Samsung phone as it will work with select models with the upcoming One UI 5 update.
