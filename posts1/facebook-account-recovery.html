How to protect Facebook account that you still have access to?
</b>

<br><br>

Change your password immediately if you feel that someone else is accessing your Facebook account, but you can still log into your Facebook account. After that check which other devices are logged into the Facebook account. If it appears that your account is logged into your account from devices you don't know, remove them all.

<br><br>

Even after following the above two steps, you should inform Facebook that there is a problem with your account. For that, you have to log in to "Secure Account". Here Facebook recommends what to do to increase the security of your account. Here you will also see the activities performed in your account in the past period. You must confirm that the activity was done by you. If it's not you, get rid of it


This is because someone else has logged into your account and engaged in various activities. Next visit the “Password and Security” page and click on “Get Help” and report the incident.

<br><br>

The next thing to do is to report to the Cyber Crime Unit. File a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center for your own protection. This is so that you don't get into trouble in the future if someone uses your account for illegal activities.

How to Recover a Hacked Facebook Account You Can't Access?
</b>



  <br><br>
If you can't log into your account, visit Facebook.com/hacked. Here, Facebook will ask you for the phone number you used to open the account. Enter it. Here you will find instructions for regaining access to your account and suggested security measures for the future.

  <br><br>
Facebook will immediately lock your account if it detects suspicious activity on your account. You can unlock it within a year. Here, you will have to go through a simple process such as giving the opportunity to recognize the comments you have made, submitting photos of your friends and allowing them to be recognized. If not, it will check your personal details like birthday to confirm if the account belongs to you and give it back to you.
