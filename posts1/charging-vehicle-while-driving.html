In this way, the first road that can be charged while driving an electric vehicle is ready to start in America next year.



<br><br>

In this way, EV (Electric Vehicle) can be charged wirelessly, the cost of constructing huge highways is high, but this system is most suitable in cases of fuel problems in heavy road congestion.

<br><br>

The initial work of this road has been planned by the Israeli company Electron. The pilot project is scheduled to be completed next year in Detroit, Michigan, and will initially be about a mile long.

<br><br>

This method works by connecting an underground network of charging coils to a power source.


<br><br>
 
Also, EVs need to have a receiver to charge when driving on them.



  <br><br>
you guys


You might think that animals walking on this road will be electrocuted as well as people. Not really. Without an active receiver, the system does not emit electricity, so there is no risk of electrocution.

  <br><br>
Each of these coils is modularly connected to the network individually, so even if there is a small fault, it will not affect the entire charging system.
  <br><br>
  The charge per mile depends on the vehicle and how fast it is going. However, currently the road does not fully charge a battery, especially when a charging station is needed, this will provide enough charge to reach it.

  <br><br>
   Subscribers can install a tab for payment and can pay the relevant fee later.

  <br><br>
    Electreon representatives claim that bus routes would be a good place to implement this charging system.
<br><br>
Because in congested areas your vehicle has enough time to charge while it is stuck in traffic.


<br><br>
This idea is like a superior version of Logitech's PowerPlay system because it allows you to charge a wireless mouse while using their mouse pad.
