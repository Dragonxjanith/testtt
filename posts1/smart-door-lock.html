A smart door lock is one of the smart home devices. Smart lock technology has evolved over the past few years to include security cameras, alarms, intercom capabilities, remote control, and many other useful features. This can be controlled remotely with an app on your phone. Whether you're at home, at work or on vacation, you can control door locks via phone. If you have a smart door lock, you don't have to worry about forgetting to lock the door or the key.



<br><br>

Wherever you are, you can open the door for a family member or roommate who has forgotten the key. In addition to the app, it can be controlled by voice through assistants like Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant. Smart door locks are easy to install. The Smart lock can be connected to the app using Bluetooth or WiFi.

<br><br>

Some smart door locks can receive a code for just one day and email it to someone. It can be deactivated again after the concerned person enters the house and leaves after doing the required work.


<br><br>

In addition to being controlled by phone, you can use passcodes, your fingerprint, scan and digital keys. Some Smart locks can even be unlocked with conventional metal keys.



<br><br>
 
Ex: Lockly Vision



  <br><br>
  <br><br>
With the video camera in a smart door lock, you can see the people at your door through the app. The intercom system allows you to talk to the people at your door. These tasks can be done through your phone wherever you are. If an unknown person enters your premises, an emergency siren will sound to scare away. In such a case, pressing a button provided by the application automatically sends a call to the emergency number.

  <br><br>
The only downside to smart door locks is that they require electricity to operate. Will not work in the absence of electricity. But if you have an extra normal key for the Smart lock, you will be able to open the door even when there is no power. Most smart locks are powered by batteries. Some smart door locks come in the market with a rechargeable battery pack. The device automatically sends a notification to your phone when the lock's battery is low.
