Many people must have known by now that 5G is coming soon. But if you ask what is 5G, or what is the importance of 5G, many people will not have the right answer. It is reported that this technology, known as the next era of broadband connections, is powerful enough to provide customers with an internet connection that is 40 times faster than 4G LTE. The reason for that is the use of waves belonging to different regions of the spectrum (variety of spectrum bands). Radio waves (mmWave Radio Spectrum) that can carry a large amount of data within a short distance


include. But as one of the problems of using high frequency waves, it can be pointed out that it can be more easily disturbed due to climatic conditions and tall buildings.

<br><br>

<br><br>

Apart from that, small cells, massive MIMO, beam-forming, and beam-tracking can be introduced as some of the most important technologies used in this 5G.


<br><br>
ðŸ”µ Small cells: portable base stations that work with low electrical capacity. When looking for facts, it became clear that this technology can be provided to customers by setting up devices to create small cells in different cities.

<br><br>

ðŸ”µ Massive MIMO (Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output): This gives the ability to communicate with a large number of devices at the same time. According to current reports, this 5G antenna can handle about 100,000 devices at the same time. A 4G antenna can only support 100-200 devices at the same time.

<br><br>
 
ðŸ”µ Beam-tracking : Here, if any device that has received 5G, moves from one place to another, it is also possible to track that device and provide a signal.




  <br><br>
ðŸ”µ Beam-forming: If there are more people using 5G in a certain area, more 5G signal is directed to that area. Due to this, even if the number of people using internet services increases, we can get a very good speed. It is said that if the people using internet services are spread approximately equally in all areas, signal distribution will be done equally to all those areas.

5G technology will come to us by next year with very high download speeds and very low latency errors from various organizations and service providers. Even now, world-class organizations like Samsung, Verizon, Ericsson are conducting research on signal processing, chips, and antenna technologies suitable for 5G technology. However, as soon as 5G technology comes into use, we will not have the opportunity to get rid of 4G and 4G LTE technologies. Because the devices currently in use are not built in a way that corresponds to 5G technology. But with time, there will be a time when only 5G technology will rule.
  <br><br>
 
Many people believe that 5G will have a huge impact on concepts like interactive TV, HD and 3D video, social gaming, virtual reality and augmented reality. These days, 5G technology is being tested very successfully in different parts of the world. Recently dialog institute also tried this centering in Colombo. However, at a time when 5G technology is popular, we will all be able to get a great internet experience.
