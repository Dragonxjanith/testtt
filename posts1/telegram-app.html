It can be said that Telegram is currently the best and highest app in terms of security and it offers more features than the apps we currently use like WhatsApp and Messenger. So let's see what advantages we have with this Telegram.

<br><br>
<b>Cloud-Based</b><br><br>

We don't need to bother to backup messages like Whatsapp, Messenger, they are automatically backed up, even if we change the device, as soon as we log in to the new device, the old messages are automatically backed up.

<br><br>
<b>Coordinate</b><br><br>

The most special thing about this is that it has something that no other messaging app can do. That is the ability to add groups of up to 200,000 people.



<br><br>
<b>Store</b><br><br>




As I said before, the photos and videos that come to us are due to the unlimited cloudThe search is done in the cloud, so there is no storage problem, we only have the ability to search the gallery.
<br><br>
Not only that, the app also has some security features. Those who use Telegram PC can enter password to lock the app. Also, for mobile users, you can use fingerprint to lock the app. I didn't say about Telegram PC. Yes, there are Telegram PC versions too, but there are no major differences.
<br><br>
Also, when we join the group there, it shows our phone numbers like in WhatsApp. But it is not like that in Telegram. The username we enter will be shown. It is also possible to change the username at any time.
<br><br>
We can also send a file. The maximum size can be sent up to 1.5GB. The most valuable thing about this is that we have the ability to permanently delete both the messages that we have sent and the messages that someone else has sent to us. That will be important to many people.
<br><br>
The other best thing is that it has a dark mode. Like WhatsApp, we also have the ability to use chat backgrounds.
