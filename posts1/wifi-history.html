We all know that WiFi is something that helps us a lot in our daily life, so where did this WiFi come from? WiFi was actually invented in 1971 when ALOHAnet was created by connecting all the Hawaiian Islands
A UHF packet transfer network, so this is always used to connect to the Internet later, and ALOHA is a network system discovered by a group of University of Hawaii students.<br><br>


In the early days this was subject to the ALOHA protocol, later this means 1985 from the US Federal under the ISM band (Industrial,Scientific,Medical) category subject to IEEE 802.11 protocols to experiment. But no one was allowed to release a license product from this. So, when working with this, NCR Corporation together with AT&T connect their POS and Cashier System to the LAN Network using this WiFi and they call it WaveLan. comes to life
<br><br>

The organization called WiFi Alliance gives the WiFi certified certificate to all WiFi products. Category products called IEEE 802.11a/b/g are called WiFi products, so to be a WiFi product, they must be subject to those protocols.
<br><br>

The frequency of these categories is divided as follows,<br><br>
<Ul>
<li>802.11a : 5GHz
</li>
<li>
802.11b : 2.5GHz
</li>
<li>
802.11g : 2.5GHz

</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

We know that 5GHz is the frequency, as the frequency increases, the distance it travels decreases, so the WiFi range also increases and the amount of data it can carry is more than the 2.5GHz frequency. So, it would be better to change this band on your router, if the biggest band was set to 5 GHz, now you would know the difference between the two.


<br><br>
 
My choice is that if you work in a small room or if you want to limit your WiFi network to just one room in a house, a living room in a hotel, it is best to go for the 5GHz band because it allows you to exchange large amounts of data in a very short time.



  <br><br>
  So, on the other hand, if your WiFi network is used by the whole house, or if you want to share your network to a larger area, then going to the 2.5GHz band is the best solution.
  <br><br>
WiFi has become an indispensable thing for us today. Through this, we have been able to use the devices we use in our daily life very easily and safely.
