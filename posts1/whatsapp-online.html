The WhatsApp app has started giving users the ability to manage who can see that you are online when you are online. It has the ability to hide online presence for Android Beta testers. This new feature will be available through WhatsApp beta Android 2.22.20.9 Version.


<br><br>

This option was first announced this yearIn August. It allows users to change their Last Online Status to 'Nobody', 'Contacts' and 'Everyone'.

<br><br>
Announcing this, WhatsApp later said, “Online helps us feel connected when chatting with friends or family, but there are times when we want to check our WhatsApp in person. There are times when you want to keep people from knowing you're online, so we're introducing the ability to choose who can and can't see when you're online. We will begin rolling this out to all users this month."

<br><br>

If you are a WhatsApp beta user want to check whether you got the feature or not? You can do that by going to Settings. Tap on Account and then tap on Privacy. If you have got that option, you will see 'Last seen and online' option here. To manage online, select "same as last seen" so that your online presence is already seen to be shared only with your shared with people that can already.
