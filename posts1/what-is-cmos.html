This CMOS is also known as RTC (real-time clock), NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) or CMOS RAM. CMOS stands for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor. CMOS is an onboard, battery powered semiconductor chip used to store information inside computers. If you look at the range to be stored, it will be stored from the system time and date to the system hardware settings. The common CMOS coin cell battery (Panasonic CR 2023 3V) is used to power up the CMOS memory.

<b>
History of CMOS
</b>
<br><br>

The Motorola 146818 chip was the first RTC and CMOS RAM chip
Used in early IBM computers. It could store a maximum of 64 bytes of data. Because the system clock used 14 bytes, 50 bytes were left to store the system settings.
<br><br>
As of today, many computer settings have been moved from CMOS and integrated into southbridge or Super I/O chips.


<br><br>
<b>
How long does this CMOS battery last?
</b>

<br><br>
 
The standard life time of CMOS battery is about 10 years. But this depends on the usage and the environment of the computer.




  <br><br>
Devices that use CMOS
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Digital Logic circuit</li>
<li>SRAM (Static RAM)</li>
<li>Microprocessor</li>
<li>Microcontrollers</li>
</ul>

  <br><br><b>
How do we know if our CMOS battery is failing?
</b>

<br><br>

If the CMOS battery fails, our computer cannot keep the correct date and time.


<br><br>

When the CMOS battery fails, we see several indication messages.


<br><br>
<ul>
<li>CMOS Read Error</li>
<li>CMOS Checksum Error</li>
<li>CMOS Battery Failure</li>
<li>System Battery Voltage is Low</li>
</ul>
