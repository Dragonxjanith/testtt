Last Friday, Binance calculated that between $100 and $110 million worth of tokens had been stolen by hackers. Because of this, the operation of the affected Blockchain has been stopped for a period of eight hours.

<br><br>

Later, the company stated that the hackers had stolen about 02 million BNB Cryptocurrency. The value of one BNB Cryptocurrency is approximately $284. Bina


This hacker attack has been carried out targeting the BSC Token Hub, which is a bridge between two nce systems.



<br><br>
 



Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, posted on his official Twitter account that the currency is now safe and apologizes for the inconvenience.

  <br><br>
Also, in their blog post, it is further stated that hackers were able to steal Binance Cryptocurrency due to a bug in the Bridge Smart Contract. Also, according to them, due to this theft, they have lost about 100 million dollars in a way that they cannot get back.
