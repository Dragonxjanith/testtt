One of the first money making options here is the Reels Play bonuses program. Eligible Creatos have the number of Views of their Eligible Content


It is possible to earn up to $35,000 per month. Interested Creators can register to get started and the knowledge required to learn how to make Reels is also provided. Along with this, there are plans to expand Facebook Reels to other countries next year.
