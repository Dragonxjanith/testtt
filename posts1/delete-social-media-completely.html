Those who read Android workers may already know the dark side of social media or social media. This is about how to delete the account in the right way to leave a social media website forever or to create a new account.


<br><br>
Even if you don't pay much from social media companies, this company earns a good income from the things you upload. Therefore, such a valuable customer is not allowed to leave this easily. Even if you think you quit, it probably isn't.

<b>Facebook</b><br><br>
<img width="65%" src="img/4-2.jpg" class="center">
<br><br>
Spending so much time by hand


From facebook you may have contributed a small amount to Mark Zuckerberg's 87 billion dollar fortune. That's why Mark won't let you "go" easily.




<br><br>
Even after deactivating a Facebook account, when you reactivate it, nothing seems to have happened because your information is only being hidden from others. Facebook works well with that information.



<br><br>
If you want to deactivate the account for a while, go to Settings and Privacy in Settings. Click on Your Facebook Information. From there click Deactivation and Deletion and select Deactivate Account. Finally, click Continue to Account Deactivation and do the deactivation according to the instructions.


<br><br>
But if you want to delete the Facebook account, select Delete Account in the previous Deactivation and Deletion option and click Continue to Account Deletion. Type the password and continue. Then click Delete Account.


<br><br>
right now No, it will take a few days to delete all your details. You are only making a request. Now, if you log into Facebook again within this time, your request will be removed. The best thing is to not log into Facebook for a few days. Delete the facebook app.


<br><br>
But it is wise to download all the information in your account before this. After clicking Settings > Your Facebook Information > Download Your Information, you will receive an email with a download link. Download this quickly because this link will expire in a few days.

<br><br><br>



<b>Instagram</b><br><br>

<img width="65%" src="img/4-3.jpg" class="center">

<br><br>

Mark Zuckerberg's another source of income, Instagram, is a mobile phone based app, but it is not possible to delete the Instagram account from mobile. You have to log in and delete from Instagram Web itself.

<br><br>
Instagram settings can only temporarily disable the account like Facebook. Although your photos, likes, comments are not visible to others, Facebook servers have all those details.

<br><br>
If you want to disable Instagram, go to your account page and click Edit Profile. There is an option to temporarily disable at the end of the page.
<br><br>
If you want to leave Instagram completely, go to the link below and type the password and click Permanently Delete My Account.

<br><br>

<hr>
<br><br><br>





<b>Twitter</b><br><br>

<img width="65%" src="img/4-4.jpg" class="center">

<br><br>

Before deleting the Facebook and Twitter account, it is wise to download the things you have uploaded to it. To do this, go to Profile, click Account and go to Your Twitter Data option. After typing the password and confirming it, you can download your data.


<br><br>
To delete the account completely, click Deactivate Your Account at the bottom of Settings > Account. Once the password is typed and confirmed, the account will be deactivated.


<br><br>
But like Facebook, it takes 30 days for your account to be permanently deleted. If you want, you can reactivate the account within this time. After 30 days, Twitter will "start" to delete your account. According to the Twitter privacy policy, this may take several weeks.

<br><br><br>





<b>Snapchat</b><br><br>

<img width="65%" src="img/4-5.jpg" class="center">

<br><br>

Go to the link below and log in by typing your Snapchat username and password. Now the account will be deactivated. But this also takes 30 days to be completely deleted.
