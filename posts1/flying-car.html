Alef's Model A, an electric vehicle in the works, has been dubbed the world's first flying car.

<br><br>
The car is capable of vertical take-off and has a range of 110 km (68 mi).


<br><br>
The company is also hoping to compete with the market already occupied by advanced car makers AirCar and Pal-V gyrocopter, which fly and drive the car.


<br><br>
But Jim Dukhovny, CEO and co-founder of Alef, says in his opinion that many of the vehicles currently claiming to be flying are not flying cars.

<br><br>
"A flying car has to be a car, in the sense that it can drive on a normal street, park in a normal parking space. And it has to take off vertically," he also told the BBC.


<br><br>
 
According to him, people have been waiting for such a flying car for 100 years. Alef's sole ambition and goal is to start selling these flying vehicles in 2025.
