You already know that Intel has launched their latest 13th Gen Processors. In addition to this, Intel released information about another special app.


<br><br>


This App launched under the name of Unison is a tool that can integrate Windows Platform and Smartphone. It has been stated that this supports VPN, firewall and IT. With WiFi, Bluetooth or Cellular Networks, the Smart Phone and PC can be wirelessly connected through this App.


<br><br>


Accordingly, users will be able to exchange files, photos, videos and many other things very easily. However, the data transfer speed that will be effective when sharing data through this app is still up to the companyInformation not provided. Also, this App is currently supported only by some HP 12th Gen Evo PCs and it can be expected that this will be provided for other PCs in the future.




<br><br>





If you work in the Apple Eco System, it is certain that you have already experienced similar features between your iPhone and Apple Mac. Also through this app you will be able to get basic features like calls, texts and file sharing as well as features like reworked network connections. And it is certain that it will be better than the <b>Microsoft Phone Links App</b> currently used for Windows and Smart Phones.
