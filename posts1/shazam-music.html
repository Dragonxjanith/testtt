For those who don't know what Shazam is, if we give a brief explanation, this is an app that lets us find out what song is playing around us. When we get familiar with the song but can't remember the name, this app becomes very important when we have to google it and download it.



<br><br>

If you look at how this works, first of all, the company has a library of more than 8 million songs, and they use this technique to create simple numerical signatures (each track has a different signature). That Andrew Fisher is Shazam CEO.

<br><br>

After that we open the app and hold our device to the direction where we hear the song.Within a few seconds, they search Shazam's Libris and show us the song that matches the generated code.

<br><br>
As mentioned above, it can recognize not only songs that are playing around, but also things like theme songs from movies.
