A problem faced by many people who use the Internet from an Android Phone or Tab is that the data runs out fast (not only for Android, this is a common thing for any smart phone OS).



<br><br>

In this article, we will give you some ways to reduce the data going to the Internet from Android.

<br><br>
1. Using the Opera Max App: This app has more than 10 million downloads and has a 4.3 rating. He has created this app especially to save data.
<br><br>


2. Using Google Chrome's Data Saver Feature: Most people use Chrome as their browser. If you don't want to switch to Opera Max, use Chrome's Data Saver Feature. It can be turned on through Setting -> Advanced -> Data Server.



<br><br>

3. Using the Facebook Lite App instead of the Facebook App: Facebook Android App is available for everyone who has Android



It is used as one. That app also consumes a lot of data. By using the Facebook Lite App, it can be greatly reduced.
