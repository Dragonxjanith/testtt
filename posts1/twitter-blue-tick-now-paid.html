This is a nightmare for many, good news for others. Twitter Blue Tick has officially become a paid thing. After rumors spread about this, Elon Musk has announced that users can easily make their Twitter profile a verified profile by paying for Twitter Blue Subscription.



<br><br>

In a recent tweet, Elon Musk revealed that the Twitter Blue Subscription now costs $8 per month and includes the privilege of having his profile verified. Previously per month for Twitter BlueIt cost $5. Thus, any person who is ready to pay can easily get Blue Tick without the hassle of verification process.

<br><br>

Elon Musk has revealed that the price of Twitter Blue will vary for different countries based on purchasing power parity. So, maybe, its price will be much lower for us in Sri Lanka. It remains to be seen if this will apply to existing Blue Tick holders as previously reported.

<br><br>

Twitter Blue, in addition to the new price, also has several new features. This includes the ability to post longer audio and video, actually see fewer ads, and prioritize replies, mentions, and searches.



<br><br>
 
Twitter's subscription service allows you to read ad-free articles, edit tweets and more. You can find more information on Twitter Blue here. However, it is reportedly removing the ability to access ad-free articles. Instead, Musk has revealed that it will provide an option for interested publishers to skip paid content. He also wants to introduce a new revenue model for content creators.




  <br><br>
In addition to the many changes being made, Twitter will also include a secondary tag for celebrities. It is currently happening for politicians.
