Facebook is constantly adding new features and services to its platform for its users to use the platform more efficiently and easily. So this social media giant announced a Wikipedia powered knowledge box as another new revolutionary feature creating a good opportunity to increase knowledge through their platform. They call it Facebook Knowledge Box. This is currently running as a pilot program and is currently only available on a few platforms.

<b>
Features and functions of Facebook Knowledge Box

</b>
<br><br>

The primary function of this is to provide relevant information after the user searches for details about things like public places and figures. Due to this, the user does not need to go out of the platform and search. Facebook shows it as a convenience. According to them, this feature works as a regular search bar.

<br><br>

<img width="50%" src="img/17-1.jpg" class="center">
<br><br>
For example, when a user searches for a famous public place or a public figure, a small knowledge box will pop up on the right side. From that box, relevant details about what was searched are given. Currently, this shows a limited amount of information related to each subject. Also, it gives information not only about famous people and places, it also gives the user the ability to get details about things like songs and movies.

<br><br>
And another important thing is that this is currently working only in English language. In future, every user will get this feature like in other languages. But Facebook has not yet announced when that will be.


<br><br>

According to reports, this feature will be available first for desktop, mobile web and iOS. After that we can hope that we will get this feature in the Android app as well. But it will be possible to confirm it only after Facebook releases this feature to the global market.



<br><br>
 
By introducing this feature, Facebook hopes to help users get the information they need without leaving the Facebook platform. Here, the convenience of the user increases and the ability to develop his knowledge within the platform is also available.
